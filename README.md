# OVERVIEW

[TITAN's](https://titansoftwork.net) Spoofer is designed to protect your Main/Alt accounts from Byfron's HWID tracking & Roblox's Ban API. To use this effectively, a VPN is essential.

The Spoofer prevents the other accounts on your PC from being banned when exploiting (Scenario: You exploit on alt, spoof, switch to main -> Only alt gets banned)

With Roblox integrating a ban API and combining Hyperion (Byfron's) detection mechanisms, exploit developers have begun offering paid spoofers. I've decided to give the community a **free, open-source** solution.

### HOW IT WORKS

The spoofer deletes Roblox & all relevant files then changes hardware identifiers (HWID's) that Roblox specifically checks. Then, (Assuming you have Bloxstrap or Fishstrap) will automatically re-install Roblox. This is done purely in usermode and any altered values will reset on PC restart.

If you'd like any functionality stripped/removed the source is extremely clear and can be easily altered & recompiled for personal use.

# FEATURES
- **Ban API/Byfron Fingerprinting Bypass** - Spoofer changes all values used in it's HWID check.
- **Byfron HWID Ban Removal** – This'll get around the extremely rare HWID bans.
- **Automated Roblox Reinstallation** – Uses **Bloxstrap/Fishstrap** for reinstallation, with **RobloxInstaller** as a fallback.  
- **Antiban Guide** – Includes a full guide on avoiding bans and understanding how the Ban API & Byfron works, available in the **[TITAN Discord](https://hub.titansoftwork.net)**.
